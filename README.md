INTRODUCTION

PolkaCipher is a Polkadot-based privacy-preserving oracle network focused on bringing the use case of private NFTs to off-chain businesses and be a bridge for seamless integration to on-chain Defi apps.
PolkaCipher's unique offerings help push the use-case of the NFTs in real-world scenarios while still being connected to a cross-chain network that is fair and accurate. PolkaCipher intends to achieve business goals by helping users transact privately and securely using NFTs as a mode of access to different decentralized apps (dapps) and real-world businesses.

GOALS

PolkaCipher aims to finally break the barrier between blockchain and real-world data through the commercialization of NFTs and accelerating adoption of decentralized finance into everyday lives.
Although demand for such services is vast, we are focused on one niche, "The Commercialization of NFTs". 
Our NFTs can be used to privately transact between two parties without revealing any information to the public and can be made fully or partially available upon request. Our private registry will use Merkle proof to secure data in our NFT registry. Once data is secured, we will provide an anchor for the registry to be accessed by the user to mint/distribute NFT with other parties.
